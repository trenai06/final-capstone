    - Features/ Storytelling
        .  Stories and Chores
        . think about the flow of the pages. 
        . tile: This title should be short, descriptive, and include the specific user/persona
        . Business case: Who want the functionality, why and to what end
        . Acceptance criteria: This defines what you will walk through to make sure that the story is completed.

    - The purpose of the story is the why. If you don't have a reason for doing something, then why are you doing it. Having a story helps you to break things down into smaller bits. takes you into the journey of what is going to happen.
